    "This technique is particularly effective for long-form content, storytelling, or educational materials. It encourages users to engage with the content at a comfortable pace.",
    "The blur and opacity transitions work together to create a sense of depth. Unread text appears distant and unclear, while the current reading position comes into sharp focus.",
    "You can customize the scroll thresholds, animation curves, and visual effects to match your brand's aesthetic. The key is maintaining readability while adding visual interest.",
    "Notice how the text ahead remains partially visible, providing context without overwhelming. This creates a natural flow that mimics how we actually read and process information.",
    "The animation is performance-optimized using Framer Motion's useTransform, which runs on the GPU. This ensures smooth scrolling even with multiple animated elements on the page.",
